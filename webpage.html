            Ed Sheeran is a British singer-songwriter known for his heartfelt lyrics and acoustic style. He has won numerous music awards and performed on stages around the world. This website showcases his albums, tours, merchandising, and top singles. I attend DCL STEM and Iâ€™m a big fan of Ed Sheeran and his music, which is why I chose him as my artist.
